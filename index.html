title:  "Welcome to your Music Workshop!"
---

<p>
Hello everybody! I'm happy to welcome you in one of our first higher level workshop at OTS Brussels!  In this workshop, you'll learn many things. Among others, you'll get to learn the basis of sound theory as well as discover how to apply that to your own computer and sound card. In short, in a matter of minutes you'll be making music on your computers by using the underlying realm of the reality layer: mathematics. But don't flee yet, it's heavy on the bass, low on the maths.

<p>
As always, the "beta disclaimer". This is the first iteration of the material & workshop. We'll do our best for it to go smoothly but some corner might have not been ironed out. Be sure to tell us if you see any issues, or if you think of ways to make it better. Furthermore, it's the first time we're using this gorgeous (yes it is) template. If you have specific ideas on how to make it better, be sure to let us know. And alas, not many pictures this time around, but I promise we'll have more next time! At last we have syntax highlighting now. Yay!

You'll see often two sides in this workshop. Straight theory, and ground-earthed application. If you should be very clear and precise on the theory aspect, you can (read must :p) explore about its potential applications. Mess with the parameters, add stuff, break the rules (if not the system) and rebuild them. Very early on you'll have ways of expressing yourself, don't forget to do so. We're not only learning how to make music, we're making music.
</p>

<p>Now, I know you're not anymore beginners, but a sane reminder:
<ol>
  <li> Best be not copy pasting if you want to understand what you're doing;</li>
  <li> Don't hesitate to search when a bit lost. But not for too long, other students and coaches are here to help you;</li>
  <li> Life has a start and a time-line, this workshop too. If you don't understand some part (and if we did our job correctly, big if) you might to check back a little bit, or read the next paragraph.</li>
</ol>
</p>

Don't forget that OTS Brussels is living through you. If you're happy about what you did, share it (would that be on our meetup pages or on social media). Don't hesitate to post comments, pictures or even sound samples of what you did!

Now that we have a clearer view of what await us, let's dive into the realm of music!
