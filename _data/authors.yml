  bio: I am a PhD student at IRIDIA (Belgium) in artificial intelligence and works in parallel as a technological artist. I've been highly interested in the writing of code as a creative process and the liberty that emerges when a programming language is seen as any other language. I've been working my fair share on gesture and its visualisation, as well as new kinds of interaction. Always eager to work on new projects, hit me up!

  bio: I'm an audiovisual application programmer and designer. Born in France, I'm always been passionate by computers, graphics, music and programming. Freshly graduated, I moved to Brussels in Belgium in 2003 to work at ArKaos, participating in the making of various reference real-time visual software solutions for live shows. Through time, my solid experience in digital medias naturally made me involved in several artistic projects. Amateur musician and curious about audio programming, I started working on the Protein mobile musical project by releasing Protein[DS] for NintendoDS in 2007, its successors Protein Der Klang and Beatbox Looper for iOS in 2013.
